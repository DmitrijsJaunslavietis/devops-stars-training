        ❌ Don't paste your entire component code, it is hard to debug it.

        ✅ Paste only the MINIMAL code that reproduces your issue (PHP/BLADE).

        ❌ Don't paste code as screenshot. 

        ✅ Paste code as formatted markdown.

        ```php
        public bool $modal = false;
        ```

        HTML

        <button label="Hi" />
